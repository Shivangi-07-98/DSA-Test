array = continuous, fixed size, 

arraylist = continuous, size can grow, 
when we want to add and size and capacity is already equal, so it will make a new array of twice capacity(whatever the current capcaity is, not old) and paste old elements and new ones
default capacity = 10
growth = 1.5 = from 10-15-22

linked list = non continuous, size can grow, 
data, node address

classes = main ke andar bnte hai aur iske bahar 
public static void main(String[] args) {
}
